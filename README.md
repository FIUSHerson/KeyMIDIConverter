# README.md

**THIS IS CURRENTLY JUST A STARTUP!**

The goal of this program is to convert MIDI inputs into keyboard strokes. However, when planning this out, I figured it would be better to allow the conversion both ways.

I do have a general idea as to how I want to create this, but for specifics, *I don't really know what I'm doing.* So I'm just gonna hope whatever I'm doing works, and something doesn't catch on fire. But if something does catch on fire, that's probably not on the code.



*README.md will be updated in the future when code is added.*
